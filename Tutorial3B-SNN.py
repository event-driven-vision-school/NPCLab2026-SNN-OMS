Task 1: Adding connections
The previous network consisted of independent neurons with spontaneous spiking. Now we will add connections and make only one of the neurons spike spontaneously.
We will form a chain of 10 neurons, where signal can travel in both directions and just the middle neuron will have non-zero baseline potential.

Run the provided script and see how the signal spreads from the spiking neuron. Play around with tau parameter to see how it influences the system.

Then return tau back to `tau = 10*ms`, disable the right-to-left connections (`S.connect(condition='j == i-1 and i > 0')`), and set the non-zero
baseline potential for the first neuron instead of the middle one.
Run the simulation. How far does the signal travel, which neuron in the chain is the most distant one to spike?

Now play with the connection strength weight `w`, explore values (0.9 - 1.1). How does the spiking behaviour change?

Set weights back to `w = 1.0` and start decreasing the refractory period from `5*ms` down to `1*ms`. How far does the signal spread for `1*ms` refractory period?
